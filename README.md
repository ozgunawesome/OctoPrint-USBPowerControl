# OctoPrint-USBPowerControl (alpha version)

Disable USB power on serial disconnect, re-enable on connect.

Otherwise the Raspberry Pi will half-assedly power the Ender 3 with only LCD working faintly.

**WARNING** This will power down all 4 USB ports and even the Ethernet port!

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

## Configuration

No configuration required.

**TODO** give at least some configurability to the end user.
